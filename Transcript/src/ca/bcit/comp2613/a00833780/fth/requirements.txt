FTH - For The Horde

1) download this package to your own repo
2) rename this package to ca.bcit.comp2613.<your student id>.fth
	* note package names are always lowercase
3) if things don't compile properly, make sure to fix your pom.xml
4) Run HordeUtilTestDriver ... you'll get an InvalidDirectoryException
	* fix this by fixing HordeUtil.getFile
5) Modify HordeUtil.createJacksonXmlMapper to create an ObjectMapper that will map to XML instead of JSON
6) Run HordeUtilTestDriver again and a file called characters.xml will be generated.
	* I'll leave it to you to figure out where this file will be generated, however the output of this will
	be needed later on


7) Start up ForTheHordeSwingApplication.  Take a look "Insert XML" button callback
	* modify the Insert XML button callback so that whatever is pasted (copy and paste the contents
	of characters.xml here) in the textarea will be saved to the DB
	* copy the contents from above to the textarea and click the Insert XML Button
8) Click the Mysterious Query Button
	* mysterious query should query the DB with a mysterious query ;)
	* this query reads from a .properties file, but the code isn't quite right to read from the .properties file = fix it
	* this mysterious query will return an arrayList of characters with a where clause
	* the button action however should ALSO grab the results back and put it in the text area box sorted by Level
9) Save the results of the textArea box (after the query) to a file (charactersReport.xml) via the Save Text Area To File button
	* you will have to add some code for this to save properly
10) push your changes on your repo to GitHub

11a) If you have NOT created your zip file for your final project do so
11b) Optional if you have done 11a / Required if not: 
		* Modify the <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version> in pom.xml to <version>final</version>
		* recreate the .zip artifact and push it up to GitHub Pages
 
Good luck!
